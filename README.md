# TextToCallUplink
MVP for testing speech synthesizer for an active call. 

For testing run this project on a physical iPhone. Call the second phone. Type text into TextField and press the "Submit" button. The Second phone should hear a synthesized speech from the text. Make sure you are using the correct language for speech synthesizing.
